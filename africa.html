        <details data-country="south-africa">
            <summary>Republic of South Africa</summary>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Landscape:</strong> Extremely diverse. The west features arid desert and semi-desert (e.g., the Karoo and Northern Cape), while the east has lush subtropical regions (KwaZulu-Natal, parts of Mpumalanga). The Drakensberg mountains run along the east, offering dramatic elevation changes. The interior (Highveld) is a plateau with grasslands and major cities. Coastal regions vary from Mediterranean (Cape Town) to humid subtropical.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Street View Coverage:</strong> Extensive. South Africa was the first African country with full Street View coverage, launched in 2010. Major highways, cities, towns, and tourist destinations are well-covered. Even rural roads, national parks, and scenic drives (e.g., Garden Route, Chapman's Peak) are often viewable.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Road Signage:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>National Roads:</strong> Labeled "N" + number (e.g., N1, N2, N3). Green signs with white text. These are major highways connecting provinces and cities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Provincial Roads:</strong> Labeled "R" + number (e.g., R21, R44). Blue signs with white text. These roads connect towns and regions within provinces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Metropolitan/Minor Roads:</strong> May also use "M" + number format (e.g., M1 in Johannesburg), especially in major metro areas. These signs are usually green or blue.</li>
                    <li><strong>City Streets:</strong> In cities like Cape Town, Johannesburg, or Durban, streets are well-labeled with names in English, Afrikaans, Zulu, or Xhosa (e.g., "Voortrekker Rd", "Umhlanga Rocks Dr"). Signage is generally good.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Driving Side:</strong> Left-hand traffic.</li>
              </ul>
        </details>

        <details data-country="botswana">
            <summary>Botswana</summary>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Landscape:</strong> Mostly flat and semi-arid, with large expanses of savannah and bushland. The Kalahari Desert covers much of the west and south. The north features more greenery, including the Okavango Delta and Chobe National Park, with wetlands and wildlife. Urban areas are scattered and surrounded by open terrain.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Street View Coverage:</strong> Official Google Street View coverage launched around 2017. Good coverage on major roads between cities like Gaborone, Francistown, Maun, and Kasane. Coverage also includes many national parks and tourist routes (especially near Okavango Delta and Chobe). Rural roads and remote villages often have limited or no coverage.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Road Signage:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Main Roads:</strong> Marked with "A" + number (e.g., A1, A3). These are tarred highways connecting major towns and border crossings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary Roads:</strong> Marked with "B" + number (e.g., B6, B300), typically narrower and may be paved or gravel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Roads:</strong> Often unsigned, especially in rural or remote areas. Signage is more consistent near cities.</li>
                    <li><strong>City Streets:</strong> In Gaborone and larger towns, streets are named in English, commonly with suffixes like "Rd." or "Ave" (e.g., "Nelson Mandela Rd", "Airport Rd"). Street signs are present but not always well maintained.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Driving Side:</strong> Left-hand traffic.</li>
            </ul>

        <details data-country="kenya">
            <summary>Republic of Kenya</summary>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Landscape:</strong> Highly varied. The central highlands around Nairobi are elevated and green, with tea and coffee plantations. The Great Rift Valley cuts through the west with dramatic escarpments and lakes. The coast (e.g., Mombasa) is low-lying, humid, and tropical. The north and northeast are arid and semi-desert. Mount Kenya (5,199 m) is the second-highest peak in Africa and dominates the central landscape.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Street View Coverage:</strong> Official Google Street View coverage began around 2015. Major cities like Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru, and Eldoret have extensive coverage. Major highways such as A104 (Nairobi–Nakuru–Eldoret) and A2 (towards Ethiopia) are also covered. Rural areas, parks, and remote regions have limited or no coverage. Some national parks like Nairobi National Park are viewable from adjacent roads.</li>
            
                <li><strong>Road Signage:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>National Roads:</strong> Labeled "A" + number (e.g., A1, A2, A104). These are the main highways, often with green signs and white text. Well-maintained near major cities, deteriorates in rural areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary Roads:</strong> Labeled "B" + number (e.g., B6, B50), connecting smaller towns. Signage is inconsistent, especially in rural areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>City Streets:</strong> In Nairobi and Mombasa, streets are labeled in English, using names like "Moi Avenue", "Haile Selassie Avenue", or "Ngong Rd". Street signage exists but may be damaged or missing in older districts.</li>
