            <ul>
                <li><strong>Landscape:</strong> Vast and diverse country. Western Kazakhstan is mostly flat steppe and
                    semi-desert. Central and southern regions continue this pattern with open plains, but the southeast
                    near Almaty is mountainous (Tian Shan range). Northeastern parts near Pavlodar and Oskemen have
                    rolling hills and forests. There are desert areas (Kyzylkum, Betpak-Dala), lakes (e.g., Balkhash),
                    and mountainous terrain near the Kyrgyz and Chinese borders.</li>

                <li><strong>Street View Coverage:</strong> Official Street View launched in 2021. Coverage is focused on
                    major cities like Nur-Sultan (Astana), Almaty, Shymkent, Karaganda, and others. Good coverage along
                    main roads (especially from Almaty to Bishkek and Astana to Karaganda). Remote areas and secondary
                    roads still have poor or no coverage. National parks or mountain roads have minimal data.</li>

                <li><strong>Road Signage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Highways:</strong> Main routes marked with "M" or "A" + number (e.g., M36, A2).
                            Signs are usually green with white text for major highways, or blue with white text for
                            regional roads. Kazakh and Russian are both used on signage.</li>
                        <li><strong>International/Euroroutes:</strong> Some roads are also labeled with E-road numbers
                            (e.g., E125), though often signed in small letters or inconsistently.</li>
                        <li><strong>City Streets:</strong> In cities like Almaty or Nur-Sultan, streets are labeled in
                            Cyrillic (Kazakh and Russian), with occasional Latin transliterations. Common suffixes are
                            "Проспект" (Prospect/avenue), "Улица" (Ulitsa/street). Examples: "Ул. Абая" (Abay St),
                            "Проспект Назарбаева".</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Google Street View Car:</strong> Typically white Pickup truck</li>

            </summary>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Landscape:</strong> Extremely mountainous – over 90% of the country lies above 1,500 m.
                    Dominated by the Tian Shan range, especially in the east and south. Central valleys are high and
                    rugged, with alpine meadows and snow-capped peaks. The Issyk-Kul region features a large salt lake
                    surrounded by dramatic mountains. The Fergana Valley in the west is flatter and more agricultural,
                    though still bordered by hills.</li>

                <li><strong>Street View Coverage:</strong> Introduced officially in 2021. Coverage is focused on
                    Bishkek, Osh, and a few major connecting routes such as the road from Bishkek to Issyk-Kul (e.g.,
                    via Balykchy), and toward the south near Jalal-Abad. Many rural or mountain roads remain uncovered,
                    especially remote passes and high-altitude regions.</li>

                <li><strong>Road Signage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Highways:</strong> National roads are labeled with "ЭМ" (EM) or "М" + number (e.g.,
                            ЭМ-01, М-41), but signage is inconsistent. Signs are usually blue or white with black or red
                            text, and often worn or missing in rural areas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Highways:</strong> most of the roads with streetview are A roads and their names are
                            "A3XX" (e.g., A365, A363) </li>
                        <li><strong>Euroroutes:</strong> Some roads also carry E-road numbers (e.g., E007, E010), often
                            unsigned or minimally marked.</li>
                        <li><strong>City Streets:</strong> In Bishkek and Osh, street signs are usually in Kyrgyz and
                            Russian. Common labels are "Улица [Name]" or just "[Name] көчөсү / улица". English
                            transliterations vary, but names like "Chui Ave" or "Manas Ave" appear on some maps.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Google Street View Car:</strong>You can see roof rack and back mirrors on the car, sometimes
                    you can see that the car is silverish grey </li>

            </summary>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Landscape:</strong> Vast and sparsely populated. Central and eastern Mongolia are dominated
                    by open steppe – grassy plains with few trees. The south is desert (Gobi Desert), featuring sand
                    dunes, rocky canyons, and barren plateaus. The north near Lake Khövsgöl is more forested and
                    mountainous. The far west (Altai Mountains) is rugged, high-altitude terrain. A country of endless
                    horizons, few paved roads, and huge skies.</li>

                <li><strong>Street View Coverage:</strong> Launched officially in 2014. Coverage is extremely limited
                    and primarily around the capital **Ulaanbaatar**, plus a few highways radiating out from it (like
                    towards Darkhan or the airport). Outside Ulaanbaatar, coverage drops off sharply. Most rural roads
                    are not mapped, especially in the Gobi and western Mongolia.</li>

                <li><strong>Road Signage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Main roads:</strong> National roads are labeled with "AH" + number (e.g., AH3, AH4),
                            though signage is rare and often only in larger cities or at major junctions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Road conditions:</strong> Outside paved roads, you'll often drive on **unmarked dirt
                            tracks** across the steppe. These may split into multiple paths and rejoin, creating the
                            classic "Mongolian spaghetti" effect.</li>
                        <li><strong>City streets:</strong> In Ulaanbaatar, streets are named using Mongolian Cyrillic
                            (e.g., Энхтайваны өргөн чөлөө = Peace Avenue). On English maps, names like "Peace Ave,"
                            "Chinggis Ave," or "Narnii Road" are common.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Google Street View Car:</strong></li>
                <li><strong>AH3 (Ulanbataar - zamyn uul)</strong> white car, black "snorkel", red back mirrors, small
                    spacing between rods on roofrack, and rod on both sides connecting roofrack rods together</li>
                <li><strong>Ulanbataar - straight down to china border</strong> small spacing between rods on roofrack,
                    and rod on both sides connecting roofrack rods together, dark blanket over back of the car. there is

                <li><strong>north of the country and from ulanbataar to east</strong> small spacing between rods on
                    roofrack, and rod on both sides connecting roofrack rods together, back of the car packed with a lot
                    of things covered with dark blanket, black snorchel and right side of the car, the car looks to be
                    dark greyish blue</li>

                <li><strong>Landscape:</strong> Extremely diverse – the north features the Himalayas, with snowy peaks
                    and winding mountain roads. Central India has forests and plateaus. The Thar Desert dominates
                    Rajasthan in the northwest. The south has lush tropics, coastal plains, and the Western/Eastern
                    Ghats (mountain ranges). Northeast India (Seven Sisters) is hilly, jungle-covered, and less
                    urbanized.</li>

                <li><strong>Street View Coverage:</strong> Officially launched in 2022. Coverage is now present in many
                    major cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata) and some secondary cities.
                    Rural areas and parts of the northeast still lack full coverage. Some national highways are also
                    covered. Narrow urban alleys may use bikes or scooters.</li>

                            Usually white on green boards.</li>
                        <li><strong>State Highways (SH):</strong> Labeled as "SH XX" (e.g., SH 12). Sign styles vary by

                        <li><strong>Urban/Rural roads:</strong> Often unsigned or shown only in local script. Street
                            signs are common in cities, usually blue or green and bilingual (local + English).</li>
