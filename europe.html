            <ul>
                <li><strong>Landscape:</strong> Very mountainous country, especially in the north and east (Albanian
                    Alps). The coast (Adriatic and Ionian Sea) is flatter with Mediterranean vegetation. Central
                    Albania is more hilly and rural.</li>
                <li><strong>Street View Coverage:</strong>Mostly around main highways and
                    cities like Tirana, Durrës, Shkodër, and some tourist roads. Many rural roads still not covered.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Road Signage:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Highways (Autostrada): Green signs, sometimes marked with "A" (e.g., A1, A2, A3).</li>

                    roads, and small towns are not covered. Imagery is from around 2010–2012 and hasn't been updated.

                    very mountainous with deep valleys and snowy peaks. The Black Sea coast (north) is lush, rainy, and
                    mountainous.</li>

                <li><strong>Street View Coverage:</strong> Partial. Good coverage in western cities (Istanbul, Ankara,
                    İzmir), touristic coastal regions, and major highways. Central and eastern Turkey have spotty or no
                    coverage. Many rural roads and smaller towns lack official Street View. Major E-roads and intercity
                    highways are usually covered.</li>

                <li><strong>Road Signage:</strong>

                        <li>Motorways (Otoyol): Green signs, labeled with "O" + number (e.g., O-1, O-3, O-21). Toll
                            roads. High quality and well signed.</li>
                        <li>State roads (Devlet Yolu): Blue signs with "D" + number (e.g., D100, D650). Most common for
                            intercity travel.</li>
                        <li>Provincial roads (İl Yolu): Usually white or yellow signs, with codes like 06-54 (first part
                            = province code).</li>
                        <li>City streets: Often labeled with "Cadde" (avenue) or "Sokak" (street). "Bulvarı" =
                            boulevard. e.g., "Atatürk Caddesi", "Barış Sokak".</li>
                        <li>European roads (E-roads): Often co-signed with Turkish roads (e.g., E80 = D100). Signed with
                            white letters on green background.</li>
